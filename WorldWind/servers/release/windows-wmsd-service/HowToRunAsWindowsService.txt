The new WMSD windows service is based on Apache Commons Daemon.

The "windows-wmsd-service" contains two sub-directories (win32 and win64),
which contain the wmsd.exe (NASA World Wind WMS windows service launcher)
and the wmsdW.exe (service monitor with a user interface that allows to change service parameters).

There is also a windows batch file InstallAsWindowsService.bat in the root folder of
the NASA World Wind WMS distribution. The script installs (registers)
the NASA World Wind WMS windows service launcher (wmsd.exe).
You need to run this script as Administrator (in Vista, Win7, Win 2008 just login-in
as Administrator is not enough, you need to elevate your access and use "Run as Adminstrator").
Edit the batch file only if you want to change execution parameters : which JDK (JVM) to use, memory sizes, etc.

Once installed, the wmsd.exe service registers itself as "NASA World Wind WMS (Web Map Service)".

There are plenty ways to start/stop the service after the install.

1. Open service.msc, locate  "NASA World Wind WMS (Web Map Service)" and manage the service using a GUI

OR

2. execute command "net start wmsd" or "net stop wmsd" (run cmd.exe as Administrator)

OR

3. go to c:\opt\wms and use "wmsd" or "wmsdW" command

wmsdW //ES//wmsd (to run service monitor and change parameters)

wmsd OR wmsd //RS//wmsd  (to start the wmsd service)

wmsd //DS//wmsd (uninstall the wmsd service)

wmsd //TS//wmsd (To run "wmsd" service in console mode, not as a service)
