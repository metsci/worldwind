    The NASA WorldWind Web Mapping Service (WMS) is an implementation of the Open GIS Consortium's (OGC) WMS
    specification, version 1.3. It is currently implemented as a stand-alone java application, and as such, is rather
    lightweight to deploy and run. It is however architected to look much like a standard J2EE container environment,
    whereby a <i>servlet</i> object acts upon request/response objects that emulate the J2EE
    <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code> classes. The intent of this design is to
    facilitate a straightforward code migration if the services of a full J2EE container environment become warranted.
</p>

<p>
    The core WMS code provides mechanisms for validating and responding to WMS requests. All policies and capabilities
    regarding the sources and organization of geospatial data to be served are made by way of plugin classes that are
    implementations of the {@link gov.nasa.worldwind.servers.wms.MapGenerator} interface. As of this release of the WMS,
    there are example <code>MapGenerator</code>s that serve the NASA Blue Marble next-generation high-resolution
    imagery, as well as NITF raster data (cadrg and CIB).
</p>

<p>
    Sources of geospatial data are configured into the WMS by adding <code>&lt;MapSource&gt;</code> elements to the
    <code>WEB-INF/config.xml</code> file. <code>&lt;MapSource&gt;</code> elements must specify a name, a description, a
    root-directory under which the geospatial data are located (directly or indirectly), and the name of the <code>MapGenerator</code>
    class that generates the requested maps. Additionally, a set of Java-style properties may be included in the <code>
    &lt;MapSource&gt;</code> element, which are presumed to be specific to the given <code>MapGenerator</code>.
</p>

<p>
    An example <code>&lt;MapSource&gt;</code> specification for the Blue Marble Generator is shown below. As
    distributed, the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/">Blue Marble NG</a> high-resolution
    series have a regular naming scheme that identifies the resolution, the depicted features, and an implicit
    geo-referencing. The <code>MapGenerator</code> expects properties that specify substrings of this name scheme for
    the particular data series, in this example, the 21600x21600 imagery with topographical and bathyrithmic features:
</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;mapsource name="bmng200401" title="BlueMarbleNG 01/2004"&gt;
             &lt;description keywords="NASA; Blue Marble; Global Imagery; 2004"&gt;Nasa's BlueMarbleNG, 2004&lt;/description&gt;
             &lt;root-dir&gt;/data/bluemarble/bm200401&lt;/root-dir&gt;
             &lt;class&gt;gov.nasa.worldwind.servers.wms.generators.BlueMarbleNG500MGenerator&lt;/class&gt;
             &lt;property name="BlueMarble500M.defaultTime" value="200401"/&gt;
             &lt;property name="BlueMarble500M.namingscheme.prefix" value="world.topo.bathy" /&gt;
             &lt;property name="BlueMarble500M.namingscheme.suffix" value="gtif" /&gt;
         &lt;/mapsource&gt;
    </pre>
<p>
    NOTE: This Blue Marble <code>MapGenerator</code> implementation uses utility programs from <a
    href="http://www.gdal.org">GDAL</a> to extract sub-regions from the source images; see <code>config.xml</code> for
    how the location of the GDAL installation on the local system can be configured into the WMS. It is further expected
    that the original Blue Marble images have been pre-processed to convert into GeoTiff format, with explicit
    georeferencing added to the files. The GDAL utility <code>gdal_translate</code> can be used to perform both steps.
