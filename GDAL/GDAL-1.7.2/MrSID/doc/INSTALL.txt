Installation Instructions for GeoExpress SDK
============================================

* No specific installation is required to use the GeoExpress SDK beyond
  copying the SDK contents to your local machine.
  
* After installing, we suggest building and running the example program
  to assure correct installation and behaviour.
    - win32 (VC7): build files can be found in examples/src/win32-vc7
    - win32 (VC8): build files can be found in examples/src/win32-vc8
    - win32 (VC9): build files can be found in examples/src/win32-vc9
    - unix: modify examples/src/makefile as required
  To execute, cd to the examples directory and execute the program;
  it should print "pass" at the end of the run and exit with status 0.

* Check PLATFORMS.txt for any additional information or updates.
