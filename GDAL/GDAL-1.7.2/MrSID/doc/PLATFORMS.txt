PLATFORM-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
=============================

The GeoExpress SDK is available for the following platforms:

  - Win32 / VC7.1
  - Win32 / VC8
  - Win64 / VC8
  - Win32 / VC9
  - Win64 / VC9

  - Mac OS X (universal) - Darwin 9 / gcc 4.0 / 32-bit & 64-bit



Use of Threads
--------------

The GeoExpress SDK is neither reentrant nor thread-safe.  However, it can be
used in a multithreaded application successfully if care is taken that the
methods of any given object are never called simultaneously.



UNIX-SPECIFIC ISSUES
--------------------

 * LizardTech libraries and applications are built with certain compiler and
   linker flags set.  Please see the file examples/src/makefile for sample
   compile and link lines.  Your environment may require modifications to
   these settings.  Please be aware that:
     - we use fPIC/kPIC
     - we use -D_REENTRANT
     - our linkage to GDAL may require you to link using -ldl
     - we use -lpthreads



WINDOWS-SPECIFIC ISSUES
-----------------------

 * VC8 treats wchar as a native type by default; the SDK does *not* treat
   wchar as a native type.  Keep this in mind when selecting project settings.



DARWIN-SPECIFIC ISSUES
----------------------

 * Darwin users must use "cp -p" when copying the SDK libraries to their local
   machines, otherwise the linker will produce messages about needing to run
   ranlib first.

 * Universal Binary users may have to update the USYSROOT variable in the
   example makefile before the examples will build.
